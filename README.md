# AltoiDS
AltoiDS is a concept for a tiny handheld gaming console inspired by classic systems from NES to DS. The idea is to fit a small single-board computer like a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W or Radxa Zero 3W and a small TFT screen inside an XL Altoids tin using 3D-printed internal shells for buttons, controls, and battery.
