I continued refining the Bill of Materials (BOM) for AltoiDS, researching and selecting components for the handheld build. Each part was evaluated for compatibility, size, and cost, including the main board, screen,
buttons, battery, and connectors. I compiled links and pricing to ensure efficient sourcing once the grant is awarded.

The project uses prebuilt components rather than a custom PCB due to my current skillset, but each piece was chosen to allow meaningful assembly, wiring, and testing, which supports a Tier 1 project. The total 
projected cost slightly exceeds $200 primarily due to shipping costs from multiple suppliers. This keeps the budget within the Tier 1 limit of $400 while allowing higher-performance parts like the Radxa Zero 3 W for 
broader emulation support, a larger TFT display, and a battery setup that provides longer playtime.

I also confirmed GPIO compatibility for buttons, selected 12×12 mm tactile switches for ABXY and D-pad controls, and smaller 6×6 mm switches for Start/Select to save space. The XL Altoids tin was chosen as the 
enclosure because a standard tin is too small for the layout, and it aligns with the project’s goal of a compact, “Altoids-sized” handheld. I planned 3D-printed internal mounts to maximize space efficiency and 
accommodate all components.

Additional components, like the TP4056 charging module and MT3608 boost converter, were chosen to support safe battery operation and stable voltage output. This BOM research ensures that once the grant is received, assembly and testing can proceed smoothly. Overall, the careful selection of parts and consideration of budget, function, and size justify the Tier 1 classification.
