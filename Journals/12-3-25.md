*Picture is just for concept, the display here is not compatible and the tin is not big enough for the final project, additionally for more computing power the Radxa 0 3W will be used for wider variety of emulation_

Since I do not yet have the grant, I haven’t been able to acquire the full components for AltoiDS, so I performed preliminary testing using parts I already had on hand. For this initial phase, I used a Raspberry Pi 
Zero 2 W to simulate the handheld console environment and imaged an SD card with RetroPie. I attempted to enter headless mode, but network configuration issues required me to reimage the SD card before I could 
successfully access the system. Once connected, I updated packages and completed a basic setup to ensure RetroPie runs properly on a compact board. I did not perform GPIO testing at this stage because the setup
requires a functional display and I currently lack an OTG adapter to connect a keyboard. Additionally, I located a limited edition XL Altoids tin to serve as the future enclosure and planned how the board, display, and 
other components will fit, taking preliminary measurements for 3D-printed internal mounts. This testing phase serves as a foundation for the project and prepares the system for full assembly once the necessary 
materials are obtained.
