I started compiling the full Bill of Materials (BOM) for AltoiDS, including links, prices, and notes for each component. I also set up a GitHub repository to track project files, documentation, and CAD designs.

I created a rough CAD prototype to visualize the outside of the console. This helped plan proportions, button placements, and the overall look. The CAD only covers the exterior because I don’t have the components yet 
to model the inside.

For the main board, I chose the Radxa Zero 3 W instead of a Pi Zero 2 W because it has more RAM and processing power. This ensures smoother emulation across a wider range of systems, which is key for a handheld that
aims to run games from NES to more demanding consoles.

The XL Altoids tin was chosen for both practical and conceptual reasons. The original idea was an Altoids-sized portable, but standard tins are too small to fit the components I need. The XL tin provides enough space 
for the board, screen, battery, and 3D-printed internal mounts, while keeping the device compact and visually appealing. It also reduces the need for fully custom fabrication while giving the finished project a 
polished look.

I also researched suitable screens and buttons, aiming for compact and compatible parts that will fit inside the tin once I receive the grant and can order the remaining components.
