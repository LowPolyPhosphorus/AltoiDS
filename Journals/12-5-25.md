Today I finalized the Bill of Materials for AltoiDS. I researched the Radxa Zero 3 W for compatibility with ILI9341 SPI displays and confirmed the GPIO pinout to plan for all button connections. I selected 12×12 mm 
tactile switches for ABXY and D-pad controls and smaller 6×6 mm switches for Start/Select to save space. I also added a 10 kΩ resistor kit for reliable button inputs.

For power, I chose a 2000 mAh LiPo battery with a TP4056 charger and an MT3608 boost converter. I decided against an internal speaker to prioritize space for wiring and the battery. The enclosure will be an XL Altoids 
tin, slightly larger than a standard one, to fit all components and allow room for 3D-printed mounts.

This stage was mostly research and planning, preparing the layout and selecting parts for the project. The total cost is still slightly above $200 due to shipping.
